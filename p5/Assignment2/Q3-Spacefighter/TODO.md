# TODO

## Actual Things I Need to Do
 - Add animation for ship movement, sprites somewhat done
 - New Enemy Types
 - Enemy Shooting
 - Background
 - Main Menu

## Ideas
 - Bullet Damage On Hit - Fade Out
 - Side Zones which alert then become a hazard area for a time
 - Side Zone which periodically becomes a shop zone, while enemies pause spawning.
    - Change Weapons
    - Change Ships
    - Save?
