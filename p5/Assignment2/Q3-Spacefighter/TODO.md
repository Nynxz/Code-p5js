# TODO

## Actual Things I Need to Do
 - Add animation for ship movement, sprites somewhat done
 - New Enemy Types
 - Enemy Shooting
 - Background
 - Main Menu
 - On Hover Buttons LEL
 - Propr Weapon Cooldowns (not frameCount bound)
 - HP BAR OUTLINE
 - HP BAR FADE TO RED ON HIT
 - ITEM DROPS GO DOWN
## Ideas
 - Bullet Damage On Hit - Fade Out
 - Side Zones which alert then become a hazard area for a time - sorta visuallyu done
 - Side Zone which periodically becomes a shop zone, while enemies pause spawning.
    - Change Weapons
    - Change Ships
    - Save?

1. Outline HP bar to give point of reference between full and current
2. Make the current health turn red when you take a hit and quickly fade back to green
3. Clamp the angle from straight down that enemies can potential fire to
4. Let power ups continue floating down-screen
