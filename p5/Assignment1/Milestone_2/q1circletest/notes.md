- Six-part  drawing.
  - [X] The  wall  is divided  horizontally  and  vertically  into  six  equal parts. 
    - 1st part: On red, blue horizontal parallel lines, and in the center, a circle within  which  are  yellow  vertical  parallel  lines;
    -  2nd  part:  On  yellow,  red horizontal  parallel  lines,  and  in  the  center,  a  square  within  which  are  blue vertical parallel lines;
    - 3rd part: On blue, yellow horizontal parallel lines, and in the center, a triangle within which are red vertical parallel lines; 
    - 4th part: On red, yellow horizontal parallel lines, and in the center, a rectangle within which are  blue  vertical  parallel  lines;
    - 5th  part:  On  yellow,  blue  horizontal  parallel lines, and in the center, a trapezoid within which are red vertical parallel lines;
    - 6th   part:   On   blue,   red   horizontal   parallel   lines,   and   in   the   center,   a parallelogram  within  which  are  yellow  vertical  parallel  lines.  The  horizontal lines do not enter the figures.(3marks)

    Challenge (1 mark): Make the drawingsscale with the size of the canvas. This can be done by keeping track  of  all  required  positions  as  a  percentage  of  the  part  of  the  drawing  they  are  in,  and  then multiplying that percentage bythe size of the drawing and offset of the part they are in.
